# ndslabs-knoweng
An experiment in running KnowEnG platform, pipelines, and IDE under [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/).

# Prerequisites
* Docker (preferrably 1.10.x - 1.13.x)
* Mount propagation must be enabled
  * See https://docs.portworx.com/knowledgebase/shared-mount-propogation.html#ubuntu-configuration-and-shared-mounts

NOTE: On my Ubuntu AWS VM, I had to run the following command (or else the kubelet container would fail to start):
```bash
sudo mount --make-shared /
```

# Clone the Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs-knoweng
cd ndslabs-knoweng
```

# Building all Docker Images
To quickly build up all of the pipeline images:
```bash
./compose.sh build
```

NOTE: If your Docker version differs, you may need to adjust the version in `./compose.sh`

To push all images to DockerHub (required for multi-node cluster):
```bash
./compose.sh push
```

NOTE: You will need to `docker login` (and probably change the image/tags in the `docker-compose.yml`) before you can push

## Multi-Node Deployment Options
Vagrant: https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray/blob/master/docs/vagrant.md
Terraform / Kubespray: https://github.com/BenGalewsky/kubespray
ndslabs-deploy-tools (deprecated): https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs-deploy-tools

## Hyperkube (single-node, containerized)
To run a development Kubernetes cluster (via Docker):
```bash
./kube.sh
```

NOTE: You'll need to manually add the path to the `kubectl` binary to your `$PATH`.

## Minikube (single-node, single VM)
See https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube

## Vagrant (single-node, multiple VMs)
See https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray/blob/master/docs/vagrant.md

# Running the Platform
To run the KnowEnG platform and a Cloud9 IDE:
```bash
./knoweng.sh
```

For an example of the running platform, see: [knoweng.org/analyze](knoweng.org/analyze)

## Behind the Scenes
The `./knoweng.sh` helper script does several things:
* Ensures that the user has a `basic-auth` secret set up for Cloud9 to consume
* Ensures that the source code is checked out to `/home/ubuntu` (you will be prompted for your BitBucket credentials)
* Generates self-signed SSL certs if they are not found for the given domain
* Ensures that certificates have been imported as Kubernetes secrets
* Create [ingress rules](ingress.yaml) to route `/ide.html` to Cloud9, and `/` to the KnowEnG Dashboard
* Starts up the Kubernetes [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress/tree/master/controllers/nginx)
* Starts up a Pod running the 4 containers comprising KnowEnG Dashboard
* Starts up a Pod running the Cloud9 IDE


# Viewing Pod Logs
To view the logs of an individual pod (where your work items are being executed):
```bash
root@knowdev2:/home/ubuntu/ndslabs-knoweng# kubectl get pods                                                                                                     
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cloud9-984f9                 1/1       Running   0          4h
default-http-backend-blrqv   1/1       Running   0          4h
nest-1442377537-3hhbf        4/4       Running   0          4h
nginx-ilb-rc-02fzw           1/1       Running   0          4h

# View the logs of a single-container Pod
kubectl logs -f nginx-ilb-rc-02fzw

# For multi-container pods, you must specify a container with -c
kubectl logs -f nest-1442377537-3hhbf -c flask
```

# Running Pipelines
To run the Data Cleanup pipeline:
```bash
kubectl create -f pipelines/dc.job.yaml
```

To run the Gene Prioritization pipeline:
```bash
kubectl create -f pipelines/gp.job.yaml
```

To run the Gene Set Characterization pipeline:
```bash
kubectl create -f pipelines/gsc.job.yaml
```

To run the Samples Clustering pipeline:
```bash
kubectl create -f pipelines/sc.job.yaml
```

This will create the Job objects on your Kubernetes cluster. Job objects themselves don't execute anything (and therefore don't keep logs),
but they will spawn Pods (groups of containers) to execute the desired work item(s).

## Monitoring Jobs
To view the status of your jobs and their pods:
```bash
core@nds842-master1 ~/ndslabs-knoweng $ kubectl get jobs,pods -a
NAME           DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
jobs/gp-test   1         1            1m

NAME                            READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
po/gp-test-hzcq8                0/1       Completed   0          1m
```

This will list off all running jobs and their respectives pods (replicas).

NOTE: The `-a` flag tells to Kubernetes to include pods that have `Completed` in the returned list.

## Viewing Pod logs
Use the pod name to check the log output:
```bash
# View the logs of a Pod spawned by a Job
kubectl logs -f gp-test-hzcq8 
```

## Viewing output files
Check the contents of your shared storage to view output files:
```bash
core@nds842-node1 ~ $ du -h -a /var/glfs/global/jobs

```

We can see that no matter which node ran our jobs, all of our output files are available in one place.

NOTE: On multi-node clusters, you will need to SSH to a compute node or start a container mounting the shared storage. The shared storage is not currently mounted on the master.

## Cleaning Up Jobs
Kubernetes leaves it up to the user to delete their own Job objects, which stick around indefinitely to ease debugging.

To delete a job (and trigger clean up of its corresponding pods):
```bash
kubectl delete jobs/gp-test
```

To delete all jobs:
```bash
kubectl delete jobs --all
```

NOTE: Supposedly, Kubernetes can be configured to clean up completed/failed jobs
[automatically](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#jobs-history-limits), 
but I have not yet experimented with this feature.
